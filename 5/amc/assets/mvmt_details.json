    "Why it Evolved": "A religious oriented and stable French monarchy along with the concentration of more people in French cities provided the optimal environment to develop the Gothic style starting with church architecture. It then spread to all Europe. Artists wanted to infuse more light into dark church interiors so larger windows of stained glass evolved. Church leaders wanted to bring structure and order to the illiterate masses to tell a religous story.",
    "Why it Ended": "The Renassiance art style replaced Gothic due to a need for expanded religious subject matter with more attractive art of real, human subjects informed by the discovey and appreciation of more attractive Greek classical liturature and sculpture.

    "Opinions and Commentary": "The word \"Gothic\" for art was initially used as a synonym for \"Barbaric\", and was therefore negative. Gothic 'barbarian' styles filtering down from north of the Alps posed a similar threat to the classical revival promoted by the early Renaissance. Gothic is a \"monstrous and barbarous\" \"disorder\"- Vasari. \"Pointed arches of northern architecture were an echo of the primitive huts\" - Raphael.

Romantized landscapes. An abundance of sharply outlined characters suddenly appears, robust, clear-cut personalities; lawless nature belonging just as much in the gallery of criminals as in that of great men. Character, individuality, power and energy are the passwords of the Renaissance age.  This new humanity, all these rugged and manly figures which the age had created, had also to appear in painting. In contrast to the former preference for beauty of an angelic and tender type, the problem now was to depict energetic and powerful beings; and to replace shy and feminine, though bearded, men in the pictures of the older masters by angular, harsh determined and daring types. The figures which has formerly hovered like spirits above the earth had now to stand firmly upon their own feet and become part of their earthly home. structure and position of  the figures, as in their expression, a general and uniform type of beauty prevailed. Rudimentary and uncompromising representation of individual qualities. This may  best explain all the strange physiognomies witch suddenly made their appearance in art; course men of the people with uncouth, overworked figures; peasants, with bones of bronze and pointed weather beaten features; half starved old beggars with sagging flesh and tottering bodies; neglected fellows with bald heads, stubbly beards, and long muscular arms. In place of the former dainty pose, every line is now sinew. Their firm, energetic attitude reflects the entire sprit of the rugged age. Expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. Lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation. The use of proportion – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of Giotto di Bondone, at the beginning of the 14th century. True linear perspective was formalized later, by Filippo Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti. In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings. Foreshortening – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth. Sfumato – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke. Chiaroscuro – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque period. Use of: glazing, impasto.",

    "Why it Ended": "Eventually replaced by Baroque which considered Mannerism a decadent, inappropriate and anarchic style that simply marked a degradation of High Renaissance art. By about 1580 artists began to develop a simpler, more emotionally compelling style in response to criticisms that nudity in the Last Judgement and by extension all Mannerist art was inappropriate for religious subject matter and moved to a baroque style. Mannerism popularity revived in the 20th century.",
    "Uniqueness": "Exaggerates proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. Hands and necks are elongated, heads are disproportiantely small.",
    "Relevant history": "The Medici family used Mannerist artists and art form to elevate the status of the Medici dynasty.",
    "Opinions and Commentary": "Mannerism was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael. Critics used the term in a negative sense, for works in which the artist seemed to rely too much on imagination or on conventions established by other artists. Some historians regard Mannerism as a degeneration of High Renaissance classicism, or even as an interlude between High Renaissance and Baroque.",
    "Distinctive techniques": "Exaggerates and elongates figures, proportions, necks, hands, fingers often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. Use of foreshortening as a visual means to give power and movement to key figures. Emphasizes compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity like Renaissance painting immediate before it. Artist pay exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance. Works are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.'  This is typical of the so-called \"stylish style\" or Maniera in its maturity. Elongation of figures: often Mannerist work featured the elongation of the human figure – occasionally this contributed to the bizarre imagery of some Mannerist art. Distortion of perspective: in paintings, the distortion of perspective explored the ideals for creating a perfect space. However, the idea of perfection sometimes alluded to the creation of unique imagery. One way in which distortion was explored was through the technique of foreshortening. At times, when extreme distortion was utilized, it would render the image nearly impossible to decipher. Black backgrounds: Mannerist artists often utilized flat black backgrounds to present a full contrast of contours in order to create dramatic scenes. Black backgrounds also contributed to a creating sense of fantasy within the subject matter. Use of darkness and light: many Mannerists were interested in capturing the essence of the night sky through the use of intentional illumination, often creating a sense of fanatical scenes. Notably, special attention was paid to torch and moonlight to create dramatic scenes. Sculptural forms: Mannerism was greatly influenced by sculpture, which gained popularity in the sixteenth century. As a result, Mannerist artists often based their depictions of human bodies in reference to sculptures and prints. This allowed Mannerist artists to focus on creating dimension. Clarity of line: the attention that was paid to clean outlines of figures was prominent within Mannerism and differed largely from the Baroque and High Renaissance.The outlines of figures often allowed for more attention to detail. Composition and space: Mannerist artists rejected the ideals of the Renaissance, notably the technique of one-point perspective. Instead, there was an emphasis on atmospheric effects and distortion of perspective. The use of space in Mannerist works instead privileged crowded compositions with various forms and figures or scant compositions with emphasis on black backgrounds. Mannerist movement: the interest in the study of human movement often lead to Mannerist artists rendering a unique type of movement linked to serpentine positions. These positions often anticipate the movements of future positions because of their often-unstable motions figures. In addition, this technique attributes to the artist's experimentation of form. Painted frames: in some Mannerist works, painted frames were utilized to blend in with the background of paintings and at times, contribute to the overall composition of the artwork. This is at times prevalent when there is special attention paid to ornate detailing. Atmospheric effects: many Mannerists utilized the technique of sfumato, known as, \"the rendering of soft and hazy contours or surfaces\"[33] in their paintings for rendering the streaming of light. Mannerist colour: a unique aspect of Mannerism was in addition to the experimentation of form, composition, and light, much of the same curiosity was applied to color. Many artworks toyed with pure and intense hues of blues, green, pinks, and yellows, which at times detract from the overall design of artworks, and at other times, compliment it. Additionally, when rending skin tone, artists would often concentrate on create overly creaming and light complexions and often utilize undertones of blue. Sculptures used figura serpentinata, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.",

The composition avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama. Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions. Asymmetry, with action occurring away from the centre of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical nor horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement. An impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. Use of the subject of allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read. There were emotional effects of color, overall harmony of the painting. A simplicity, precision, realism, and an emotional stimulus to piety. Contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. An excess of ornamentation. The scene is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects.  Quadratura, or paintings in trompe-l'oeil, which literally \"fooled the eye\". These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels, saints and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.

Internal feelings in reaction to external looking Impressionism and Academic art.",
    "Why it Ended": "Expressionism fell out of favor post WW I and was banned by the Nazi dictatorship in 1933 as degenerate. Artworks were taken out of galleries and seized. Expression art inspired development of a multitude of later art movements, with its characteristics still used today.",
    "Uniqueness": "Striking colors and vigorous brush work and application of paint in seemingly irrational ways. Often addresses the darker side of life. Heavily influenced by primiative native art form.  Overemphasis of the emotions highlighting their importance over a realistic interpretation within the artworks. Threatening and sinister depictions of the modern city.",
    "Relevant history": "Considered \"Degenerate\" art by Nazi regime so it attempted to humiliate artists and destroyed all such artworks.",
    "Opinions and Commentary": "“The function of the artist is to express reality as felt.” - Robert Motherwell. “Degenerate.” ",
    "Distinctive techniques": "Striking colors and vigorous, bold brush work and application of paint more to get a reaction than to accurately reflect and object. Use of extreme angles, flattened forms, garish colors, and distorted views.",
    "Typical Subjects": "Contemporary life. A world view",
    "Geographic Focus": "Germany, New York City, NY",
    "Interesting Facts.": "Munch accidentally shot off his finger which had to be amputated. He turned down anesthesia in order to paint the operation afterwards, and needed to stay awake and see what happened. Munch played with early cameras and was considered a selfie pioneer.",
    "Prominant Formats": "Painting",
    "New or Dominant Materials": "Oil paint, household paint, multiple different industrial and household materials. ",

"abstract-expressionism": {
    "Name": "Abstract Expressionism",
    "Key Timespan": "1945 - 1965",
    "Quick Take": "Dripped paint. Large canvases. No recognizable figures or objects. An emotionally charged application of medium.",
    "Feelings": "The artist's feelings and emotions, rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic, meaninglessness of life, rejection of social, religious and moral principles.",
    "Impact to you": "It dramatically broke through the confining, restrictive art establishment rules.  Opened up new world of modern art and the of enjoyment and expression of artists and viewers feelings. Also, it was the first American movement to move international art influence from Paris to New York.",
    "Why it Evolved": "The unrelenting nature of artists to be unique, to find something new and different and add to what has been done before. WWII was the important historic point. Abstraction hide social and political statements during an intolerant period and therefore safe for artists.",
    "Why it Ended": "Artists grew tired of abstract expressionism's subjective nature and moved to a multitude of new art forms such as: Surrealism, Color field, Hard-edge and Lyrical Abstraction among others.",
    "Uniqueness": "Spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious, emotional creation of solid color or dripped painting. Anti-figurative. Non-objective style. Application of medium with emotional energy and gestural surface marks. Total coverage of fields of color cool and austere color across the entire canvas. Large, flat areas of color. Use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvases are treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). Drip paintings as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing. Staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. Intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Hard-edge painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas are often of one unvarying color.",
    "Relevant history": "WWII ended. There was significant Western, U.S. government and societal censorship. CIA sponsored this art form against communist art influences.",
    "Opinions and Commentary": "\"...what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event...\" — Harold Rosenberg",
    "Distinctive techniques": "Unrestricted brush strokes and application of materials, experimentation with different materials to express feelings.",
    "Typical Subjects": "Emotional, anti-social, anti-religious, rejection of current morals, anti-political, apolitical, mythology, mysticism.",
    "Geographic Focus": "New York City, New York, United States; San Francisco, California, United States; East 9th Street, Manhattan, New York, NY",
    "Interesting Facts.": "In the early 1950s, the anti-communist CIA saw the art form as a haven of free thought and free markets thus a challenge to both the socialist realist styles prevalent in communist nations. Thus the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of cultural imperialism.",
    "Prominant Formats": "Paints of all types, sculpture, mobile, collage",
