Romantized landscapes. An abundance of sharply outlined characters suddenly appears, robust, clear-cut personalities; lawless nature belonging just as much in the gallery of criminals as in that of great men. Character, individuality, power and energy are the passwords of the Renaissance age.  This new humanity, all these rugged and manly figures which the age had created, had also to appear in painting. In contrast to the former preference for beauty of an angelic and tender type, the problem now was to depict energetic and powerful beings; and to replace shy and feminine, though bearded, men in the pictures of the older masters by angular, harsh determined and daring types. The figures which has formerly hovered like spirits above the earth had now to stand firmly upon their own feet and become part of their earthly home. structure and position of  the figures, as in their expression, a general and uniform type of beauty prevailed. Rudimentary and uncompromising representation of individual qualities. This may  best explain all the strange physiognomies witch suddenly made their appearance in art; course men of the people with uncouth, overworked figures; peasants, with bones of bronze and pointed weather beaten features; half starved old beggars with sagging flesh and tottering bodies; neglected fellows with bald heads, stubbly beards, and long muscular arms. In place of the former dainty pose, every line is now sinew. Their firm, energetic attitude reflects the entire sprit of the rugged age. Expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. Lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation. The use of proportion – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of Giotto di Bondone, at the beginning of the 14th century. True linear perspective was formalized later, by Filippo Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti. In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings. Foreshortening – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth. Sfumato – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke. Chiaroscuro – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque period. Use of: glazing, impasto.",

        distinctive_techniques: "Exaggerates and elongates figures, proportions, necks, hands, fingers often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. Use of foreshortening as a visual means to give power and movement to key figures. Emphasizes compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity like Renaissance painting immediate before it. Artist pay exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance. Works are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.'  This is typical of the so-called \"stylish style\" or Maniera in its maturity. Elongation of figures: often Mannerist work featured the elongation of the human figure – occasionally this contributed to the bizarre imagery of some Mannerist art. Distortion of perspective: in paintings, the distortion of perspective explored the ideals for creating a perfect space. However, the idea of perfection sometimes alluded to the creation of unique imagery. One way in which distortion was explored was through the technique of foreshortening. At times, when extreme distortion was utilized, it would render the image nearly impossible to decipher. Black backgrounds: Mannerist artists often utilized flat black backgrounds to present a full contrast of contours in order to create dramatic scenes. Black backgrounds also contributed to a creating sense of fantasy within the subject matter. Use of darkness and light: many Mannerists were interested in capturing the essence of the night sky through the use of intentional illumination, often creating a sense of fanatical scenes. Notably, special attention was paid to torch and moonlight to create dramatic scenes. Sculptural forms: Mannerism was greatly influenced by sculpture, which gained popularity in the sixteenth century. As a result, Mannerist artists often based their depictions of human bodies in reference to sculptures and prints. This allowed Mannerist artists to focus on creating dimension. Clarity of line: the attention that was paid to clean outlines of figures was prominent within Mannerism and differed largely from the Baroque and High Renaissance.The outlines of figures often allowed for more attention to detail. Composition and space: Mannerist artists rejected the ideals of the Renaissance, notably the technique of one-point perspective. Instead, there was an emphasis on atmospheric effects and distortion of perspective. The use of space in Mannerist works instead privileged crowded compositions with various forms and figures or scant compositions with emphasis on black backgrounds. Mannerist movement: the interest in the study of human movement often lead to Mannerist artists rendering a unique type of movement linked to serpentine positions. These positions often anticipate the movements of future positions because of their often-unstable motions figures. In addition, this technique attributes to the artist's experimentation of form. Painted frames: in some Mannerist works, painted frames were utilized to blend in with the background of paintings and at times, contribute to the overall composition of the artwork. This is at times prevalent when there is special attention paid to ornate detailing. Atmospheric effects: many Mannerists utilized the technique of sfumato, known as, \"the rendering of soft and hazy contours or surfaces\"[33] in their paintings for rendering the streaming of light. Mannerist colour: a unique aspect of Mannerism was in addition to the experimentation of form, composition, and light, much of the same curiosity was applied to color. Many artworks toyed with pure and intense hues of blues, green, pinks, and yellows, which at times detract from the overall design of artworks, and at other times, compliment it. Additionally, when rending skin tone, artists would often concentrate on create overly creaming and light complexions and often utilize undertones of blue.

        quick_take: "Distorted reality, exaggeration, primitivism, fantasy using vivid, jarring, violent, or dynamic application of brush strokes and paint for impact not reality. Emotional responses to objects and events. Think: Van Gough, The Scream.",
        feelings: "Angst. Sympathy with the artists distorted reality evoking emotional moods and or ideas in yourself. Feeling the meaning of emotional experience rather than the physical reality. Possibly experiencing a variety of anxieties and yearnings of ordinary people. Understanding the emotional expression from within the artist, a turgid emotional state, possibly an anxiety from the modern world with some social criticism. Considering the rejection of capitalism's role in the emotional distancing of individuals within cities. Opposition to what Impressionism represents. See a disillusioned commentary on contemporary society.",
        impact_to_you: "The style represents a significant departure from the path of art escaping reality and leaps to another concept of what art itself should be. The Scream by Edvard Munch placed him as one of the greatest artists in world history",
        why_it_evolved: "Evolved as a response to a widespread anxiety about humanity's increasingly discordant relationship with the world after the World War I, Depression, World War II, and accompanying lost feelings of authenticity and spirituality. Internal feelings in reaction to external looking Impressionism and Academic art.",
        why_it_ended: "Expressionism fell out of favor post WW I and was banned by the Nazi dictatorship in 1933 as degenerate. Artworks were taken out of galleries and seized. Expression art inspired development of a multitude of later art movements, with its characteristics still used today.",

Heavily influenced by primiative native art form.  Overemphasis of the emotions highlighting their importance over a realistic interpretation within the artworks. Threatening and sinister depictions of the modern city.",

Application of medium with emotional energy and gestural surface marks. Total coverage of fields of color cool and austere color across the entire canvas. Large, flat areas of color. Use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvases are treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). Drip paintings as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing. Staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. Intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Hard-edge painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas are often of one unvarying color.",
